# Kivy Virtual Keyboard
Example of a virtual keyboard that pops up on text input focus.

## Setup
In order for Kivy to recognize custom keyboard layouts, ensure that `simple.json` is located in Kivy's keyboard data folder.

For example, ```cp simple.json <path_to_kivy_venv>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/kivy/data/keyboards```
